These images represent sequential frames from a single video, captured in order. Please carefully analyze the entire sequence of frames as if they were a continuous scene. Pay special attention to any potential threats or dangers that may be present, such as suspicious individuals, unsafe conditions, hazardous objects, or risky behaviors. After examining all the frames and understanding the situation as it unfolds over time, provide very short description of what is happening in the video with a single sentence. In addition, highlight and describe the specific threats or dangers you observe with one sentence. Finally, offer practical suggestions or advice for the viewer or a person in that situation to stay safe, mitigate risks, or respond appropriately to the identified threats with a couple of short sentences. You must also identify the level of threat from 1 to 9. 1 is for the lowest level of threats whereas 9 is for the highest level of threats. For example, Your output must be in the following format: Identified threats: Approaching black bear, Suggestions: Try to stay calm; if the bear is too close, avoid sudden movements and look around for other things that can have you distract the bear,Level of threat: 9Identified threats: Fast-approaching thunderstorm with visible lightning strikes, Suggestions: Seek immediate shelter away from tall objects like trees or metal structures; avoid open fields and water bodies to reduce the risk of lightning strikes.
